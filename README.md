WSU CS466, Spring semester 2018
===============================

For the semester I will be providing lab information and supplementary files via this git-hub project.

When I have more files or updates available I'll let everyone know.  It's a good habit to pull updates before you start developing.  I will only provide corrections and new files on a regular basis, You should not (hopefully) have to worry about merge conflicts and updates to existing files.

You will want to fork this repo into your own private space, this will be an early assignment in the class.  As students you all have access to free private github accounts.

I'll handout instructions durign the first week.

Assignments and labs will be turned in via Blackboard.

The compilers for this course are available at: https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded but will be available on the lab Linux environment.  The development tools will work on Windows or OSx as well but getting USB communications and debugging environments up and running can be a challenge.
